# Breaking the Yoke of Love Crusade - Registration Website

This repository contains the code for the registration website for Blackbonez's "Breaking the Yoke of Love" crusade, a concert event designed for his fans. The website was developed during my internship at Filtar Africa and stands as my first project as an intern.

## Project Overview

The "Breaking the Yoke of Love" crusade is a major concert event organized by Nigerian artist Blackbonez. This website was created to facilitate the registration process for fans who wish to attend the event. 

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5 & CSS3:** For structuring and styling the website.
- **JavaScript:** For form validation and interactive elements.

## Lessons Learned

Working on this project provided me with hands-on experience in web development, particularly in creating user-friendly registration systems. It also enhanced my understanding of responsive design principles and the integration of backend technologies for data handling.
